## Steps:
1. Data loading and preprocessing.
2. Standardization of features.
3. Finding optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.
4. K-Means clustering and analysis.
5. Visualization of customer clusters.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
